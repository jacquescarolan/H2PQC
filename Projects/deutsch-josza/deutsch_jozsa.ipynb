    "## _*The Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm*_ \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/439/1907/553) is one of the earliest examples demonstrating the power of quantum computers. Suppose Alice has a Boolean function, i.e. a function $f(x)$ that outputs either $0$ or $1$ for every input $x$. This function is called the \"oracle\". Furthermore, Alice promises that her function is either balanced, i.e. half of the possible inputs give $0$ and the other half give $1$, or constant, i.e. every input gives the same output. Alice has a friend Bob whose goal is to determine which type of function Alice has. To do so, he can send Alice inputs and record the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, in the best case, two queries to the oracle can determine if the hidden Boolean function is balanced; in the worst case, at least half of the inputs must be queried to determine if the hidden Boolean function is constant for all inputs. However, using quantum mechanics, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can determine the Boolean function with just one query.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Inputs to the oracle are given in binary, in the form of an $n$-bit string. The algorithm can be summarized as follows.\n",
    "1. Prepare two quantum registers. The first is an $n$-qubit reqister that will be used as the input for the oracle. All qubits in this register will be initialized to zero. The second register is a one-qubit register that will be used to store the output of the oracle. This register should be initialized to one:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|0_{n-1}0_{n-2}0_{n-3}\\ldots 0_0\\rangle |1\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2. Create the superposition of all input queries in the first register by applying the Hadamard gate to each qubit (dropping subscripts for visibility):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H^{\\otimes^n} |0\\ldots 0\\rangle |1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}}\\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}|i\\rangle |1\\rangle \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|i\\rangle$ is the binary representation of $i$, i.e. $|i=0\\rangle=|0\\ldots 00\\rangle$, $|i=1\\rangle=|0\\ldots 01\\rangle$, $|i=2\\rangle=|0\\ldots 10\\rangle$, etc.\n",
    "3. Apply the Hadamard gate to the second register. This will allow us to store the value of the oracle in phase, which lets us take advantage of an effect known as interference.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}}\\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}|i\\rangle |1\\rangle \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}|i\\rangle ( |0\\rangle - |1\\rangle )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "4. Feed the input register to the oracle, flipping the sign of each $|i\\rangle$ state conditioned on the output of $f(i)$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}|i\\rangle ( |0\\rangle - |1\\rangle ) \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}(-1)^{f(i)}|i\\rangle ( |0\\rangle - |1\\rangle ) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "5. Apply the Hadamard gate to the first register\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Measure the first register. If if is zero (i.e. if it is the binary $|000....0\\rangle$), then we conclude that the oracle function is constant. If it is non-zero, then we conclude that the oracle function is balanced.\n",
