    "Grover search is one of the most popular algorithms used for searching a solution among many possible candidates using Quantum Computers. If there are $N$ possible solutions among which there is exactly one solution (that can be verified by some function evaluation), then Grover search can be used to find the solution with $O(\\sqrt{N})$ function evaluations. This is in contrast to classical computers that require $\\Omega(N)$ function evaluations: the Grover search is a quantum algorithm that provably can be used search the correct solutions quadratically faster than its classical counterparts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to illustrate the use of Grover search to solve a combinatorial problem called [Exactly-1 3-SAT problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#Exactly-1_3-satisfiability). The Exactly-1 3-SAT problem is a NP-complete problem, namely, it is one of the most difficult problems that are interconnected (meaning that if we solve any one of them, we essentially can solve all of them). Unfortunately, there are many natural problems that are NP-complete, such as, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Maximum Cut (MaxCut) and so on. Up to now, there is no classical and quantum algorithm that can efficiently solve such NP-hard problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with an example of the Exactly-1 3-SAT problem. Then, we show how to design an evaluation function which is also known as the oracle (or, blackbox) which is essential to Grover search. Finally, we show the circuit of Grover search using the oracle and present their results on simulator and real-device backends."

    "The Exactly-1 3-SAT problem is best explained with the following concrete problem. Let us consider a Boolean function $f$ with three Boolean variables $x_1, x_2, x_3$ as below.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 \\vee x_2 \\vee \\neg x_3) \\wedge (\\neg x_1 \\vee \\neg x_2 \\vee \\neg x_3) \\wedge (\\neg x_1 \\vee x_2 \\vee x_3) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above function, the terms on the right-hand side equation which are inside $()$ are called clauses. Each clause has exactly three literals. Namely, the first clause has $x_1$, $x_2$ and $\\neg x_3$ as its literals. The symbol $\\neg$ is the Boolean NOT that negates (or, flips) the value of its succeeding literal. The symbols $\\vee$ and $\\wedge$ are, respectively, the Boolean OR and AND. The Boolean $f$ is satisfiable if there is an assignment of $x_1, x_2, x_3$ that evaluates to $f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 1$ (or, $f$ evaluates to True). The Exactly-1 3-SAT problem requires us to find an assignment such that $f = 1$ (or, True) and there is *exactly* one literal that evaluates to True in every clause of $f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A naive way to find such an assignment is by trying every possible combinations of input values of $f$. Below is the table obtained from trying all possible combinations of $x_1, x_2, x_3$. For ease of explanation, we interchangably use $0$ and False, as well as $1$ and True.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## A blackbox function to check the assignment of Exactly-1 3-SAT problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we describe a method to construct a circuit to check the assignment of Exactly-1 3-SAT problem. The circuit can then be used as a blackbox (or, oracle) in Grover search. To design the blackbox, we do not need to know the solution to the problem in advance: it suffices to design a blackbox that checks if the assignment results in $f$ evaluates to True or False. It turns out that we can design such a blackbox efficiently (in fact, any NP-complete problem has the property that although finding the solution is difficult, checking the solution is easy). \n",
    "\n",
    "For each clause of $f$, we design a sub-circuit that outputs True if and only if there is exactly one True literal in the clause. Combining all sub-circuits for all clauses, we can then obtain the blackbox that outputs True if and only if all clauses are satisfied with exactly one True literal each.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let us consider the clause $(x_1 \\vee \\neg x_2 \\vee x_3)$. It is easy to see that $y$ defined as \n",

    "\n",
    "is True if and only if exactly one of $x_1$, $\\neg x_2$, and $x_3$ is True. (Explain yourself why this is the case). Using two working qubits, $y$ can be computed by the following sub-circuit. Below, $x_1x_2x_3$ is renamed as $q_1q_2q_3$, $q_4$ is used as a working qubit, and $q_5$ is used to store the value of $y$.  "
